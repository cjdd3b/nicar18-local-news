  * [Essential Twin Cities Guide](https://static.startribune.com/guide/): We put together this digital guide for visitors coming to Minneapolis for the Super Bowl. Led by newsroom developer Alan Palazzolo and digital designer Anna Boone.

  * [Find the hottest Twin Cities housing markets of 2017](http://www.startribune.com/find-the-hottest-twin-cities-housing-markets-of-2017/474967133/): Data editor MaryJo Webster calculated a custom index of hot housing markets in the Twin Cities, which data reporter Jeff Hargarten later visualized and turned into a tool for readers.

  * [Minnesota Picks the Super Bowl](http://www.startribune.com/who-s-going-to-win-minnesota-picks-the-super-bowl/469989743/): Digital designer Rahul Mukherjee, alongside reporters from the sports staff and across the newsroom, collected Super Bowl predictions from prominent Minnesotans and displayed them in this nifty layout.

  * [The North Score](http://www.startribune.com/the-north-score-our-sports-analytics-beat/469939663/): Did you know the Star Tribune has an entire beat focused on sports analytics? You should find reporter Chris Hine here at the conference and ask him about it.

## **Eric Dietrich**
### **[Bozeman Daily Chronicle](https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/)**

**Contact**: eric.dietrich@gmail.com

  * I called every bar in my paper's gentrifying college town to calculate the average price of a draft microbrew. And then I did it again a year later so I could publish an [inflation index](https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/beer-index-pints-come-to-more-bozeman-bars/article_ff583c29-174b-5b87-9516-3f87b1f719fb.html).

  * Also, for a separate cost-of-living project, I coded a React-based [interactive calculator](http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/app/newsroom/living-wage/gc-living-wage/) that readers could use to estimate a living wage for their family.

**Contact**: twilburn@seattletimes.com

  * For [this story](http://projects.seattletimes.com/2017/wsu-wolf-researcher-wielgus/), we wanted to tell the story of the Profanity Peak wolf pack as a 3D visualization. I've written a little bit about the making of this project [here](http://dev.seattletimes.com/2017/08/wolves-wsu-and-webgl-presenting-the-profanity-peak-pack/), but basically we merged multiple DEM files into a single heightmap, saved that out as the red channel of a JPG, added wolf range data to the blue channel, then loaded that into a custom WebGL renderer for display.

  * Vermont is a small state with a large tourism industry, so we wondered how home-sharing apps were altering the landscape. I [figured out](https://github.com/asuozzo/airbnb-analysis) how to get point-in-time Vermont listings from the site, which let us look at the distribution across the state. We expected to see the most listings in Burlington, our biggest city, but it turned out listings in the tiny ski towns were [off the charts](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/airbnb-snowballs-in-vermont-ski-towns-bringing-cash-and-concerns/Content?oid=10220050).

## **Evan Wyloge**
### **[Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting](https://azcir.org/)**

**Contact**: evan.wyloge@gmail.com

  * In 2016, AZCIR designed and executed the automated twitter account [@AZDarkMoneyBot](https://twitter.com/AZDarkMoneyBot), which sent tweets containing information about state-level "Dark Money" campaign finance filings in as close to real time as the state's campaign finance laws allowed. This required us to write some code to parse emails, store data, fetch filings with a headless browser, read them as PDFs, re-store new data, then arrange and send the data to the twitter account. We will be running it this year, but because of changes in reporting laws made in the middle of the 2016 election cycle (ðŸ¤”), these filings are no longer made in real time, but instead, at regular quarterly-ish reporting intervals. Obviously, this hinders the utility of our twitter account, but hopefully it will also serve to demonstrate what campaign finance laws actually mean for the public, in terms of transparency.

Although CBC is a large public broadcaster in Canada, I work out of the Montreal English newsroom, which is like a small town newsroom. We put out a few data-driven pieces that we're proud of recently.

  * [Showing how fast the asphalt deteriorates](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/multimedia/here-s-how-bad-montreal-s-asphalt-gets-in-just-5-years-1.4199896)

  * [A series](http://www.spokesman.com/pages/immigration/) we started working on after the election and dropped the day of the first travel ban. The relevant part is the news game where you can try to immigrate to the U.S. based on actual visa data

  * Not the most exciting data work, but a fun topic, looking at [roadkill salvage](http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/jan/14/experts-say-salvaging-roadkill-makes-sense-for-num/) in WA and ID. Map by me in Mapbox with no prior experience.

  * [The Live New Jersey Outage Tracker](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/winds_knocks_out_power_tens_of_thousands_across_nj.html)

  * Basically, I built a scraper that scrapes all four major utility companies in New Jersey every 15 minutes and showcase the number of people who are experiencing power outages in a series of charts and graphics. It is embeddable, but also lives in its own [project page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nj-apps/outage-tracker-2.0/data/index.html). Note: This is Phase 1 of the project. Phase 2 involves scraping town-by-town and ETA estimates. There will also be a quick load version for people who are experiencing power outages.

**Contact**: mizzousundevil@gmail.com

  *  We took blockgroup data from FEMA and property data from Harris County. I rolled up the property data to those blockgroups and used the [resulting analysis](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/hc-investigations/harvey/developingstorm/) to direct reporters to areas with a history of flooding but lots of new construction. Also overlaid property data with federal floodplain shapes to show billions in development in the the most dangerous areas.

  *  We created [this interactive](http://www.chicagoreporter.com/99reforms/#/) to help community members, political leaders, and other journalists track the progress the city is making on the recommendations for police reform made by the DOJ. This project was done by 3 people: a reporter (myself), a developer (Geoff Hing) and an editor (Matt Kiefer).
