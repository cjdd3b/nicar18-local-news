  * I called every bar in my paper's gentrifying college town to calculate the average price of a draft microbrew. And then I did it again a year later so I could publish an [inflation index](https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/beer-index-pints-come-to-more-bozeman-bars/article_ff583c29-174b-5b87-9516-3f87b1f719fb.html).

  * Also, for a separate cost-of-living project, I coded a React-based [interactive calculator](http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/app/newsroom/living-wage/gc-living-wage/) that readers could use to estimate a living wage for their family.

  * For [this story](http://projects.seattletimes.com/2017/wsu-wolf-researcher-wielgus/), we wanted to tell the story of the Profanity Peak wolf pack as a 3D visualization. I've written a little bit about the making of this project [here](http://dev.seattletimes.com/2017/08/wolves-wsu-and-webgl-presenting-the-profanity-peak-pack/), but basically we merged multiple DEM files into a single heightmap, saved that out as the red channel of a JPG, added wolf range data to the blue channel, then loaded that into a custom WebGL renderer for display.

    * Vermont is a small state with a large tourism industry, so we wondered how home-sharing apps were altering the landscape. I [figured out](https://github.com/asuozzo/airbnb-analysis) how to get point-in-time Vermont listings from the site, which let us look at the distribution across the state. We expected to see the most listings in Burlington, our biggest city, but it turned out listings in the tiny ski towns were [off the charts](https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/airbnb-snowballs-in-vermont-ski-towns-bringing-cash-and-concerns/Content?oid=10220050).
